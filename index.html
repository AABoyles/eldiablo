<p>Event data in a box, basically.</p>

<h2>
<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>The main goal of EL:DIABLO is to overcome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>
and make it much easier for the end user to get up and running with event data
coding. Using software designed for development operations allows us to easily
share the setup we use to develop the tools and software for creating and
working with event data. In short, no matter what hardware or operating system
a user chooses, it is possible to replicate our exact event-data coding
platform on that specific configuration. This goal is important to us for two
primary reasons.</p>

<p>First, we are striving to make the generation of event data more open than it
has historically been. Things such as copyright and licensing agreements make
it difficult to share source texts for coded event data, but we <strong>can</strong> make
the <strong>process</strong> as transparent as possible. This is especially important since
there are a multitude of seemingly minor choices that go into event data
coding that can have a significant impact on the final product. </p>

<p>Second, we are pursuing EL:DIABLO to enable collaboration. It will no longer be
unclear what steps are taken to generate event data, or what the various moving
pieces within the system are. If someone wishes, for example, to develop a new
event coder, they can simply drop that in to the existing pipeline. The same
holds for the various dictionaries, geocoders, web scrapers, etc. It's like
Legos. But for event data.</p>

<h2>
<a id="components" class="anchor" href="#components" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Components</h2>

<p>On the technical side of things, EL:DIABLO provides the scripts to configure
any computer running any variant of Ubuntu to begin generating event data. The
primary component of EL:DIABLO is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell script</a> called <code>bootstrap.sh</code>, which
installs all of the necessary software.</p>

<p>For computers that aren't running Ubuntu or any of its derivitives (or
computers that you just don't want to run the risk of messing up), This
repository also contains the configuration files necessary to set up a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> using
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> (and by extension <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>), to set up this virtual environment.</p>

<p>The EL:DIABLO event coding platform is comprised of two primary applications:
a web scraper and a processing pipeline (<a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/scraper"><code>scraper</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/phoenix_pipeline"><code>phoenix_pipeline</code></a>
specifically). The scraper is a simple web scraper that uses a whitelist of RSS
feeds to pull stories from popular news outlets. The pipeline moves the news
stories from storage in a database to the event coder, such as TABARI or
PETRARCH, and outputs event data. More information about the details of these
projects can be found in their respective documentation, linked to above. If
you use the standard <code>bootstrap.sh</code> script provided with EL:DIABLO, the web
scraper will run once an hour, and the pipeline will run once a day at 01:00.</p>

<h3>
<a id="installation-on-a-virtual-machine-with-vagrant" class="anchor" href="#installation-on-a-virtual-machine-with-vagrant" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation on a Virtual Machine with Vagrant</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, EL:DIABLO relies on Vagrant and VirtualBox for most of the
heavy lifting. This means that the only things that a user needs to install on
their local machine are these two pieces of software. The creators of this
software describe the install process better than we can, so a user should look
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">here</a> for Vagrant and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">here</a> for VirtualBox. Once that software
is installed, EL:DIABLO needs to be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/openeventdata/eldiablo">Github repository</a>. For those familiar with <code>git</code>, a
<code>git clone</code> should work fine. For those unfamiliar with <code>git</code>, it is possible
to download the repository as a zip file as shown in the picture below.</p>

<p><em>Note: We've tested this setup on Vagrant 1.6.5</em></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YTT6Ppy.png" title="Github example"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YTT6Ppy.png" alt="Github" title="Github example"></a></p>

<p>Once this file is downloaded and unzipped, you should use the command line to
<code>cd</code> into the directory and do <code>vagrant up</code>. This will take awhile to download
the operating system image(this will only be done once) and then install the
relevant software within the virtual machine. Seriously, this is going to take
time; the process hasn't stalled out. Then <code>vagrant ssh</code>to get into the box.
You're now in the virtual machine. Overall, this should look something like:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UJtjy3N.png" title="Terminal example"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UJtjy3N.png" alt="Shell" title="Terminal example"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/206UtDs.png" title="Second terminal example"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/206UtDs.png" alt="Shell" title="Second terminal example"></a></p>

<p>As a note, all of this will create a folder somewhere on your local machine
that contains the operating system images. On OSX it's in the home directory
and named <code>VirtualBox VMs</code>. </p>

<p>To get out of the virtual machine, type <code>exit</code>, which will bring you back to
your local machine. There are three methods for ending the Vagrant box:
<code>vagrant suspend</code>, <code>vagrant halt</code>, and<code>vagrant destroy</code>. The main difference
between these three is the amount of system resources used while in the "down"
state. If you are completely done with the virtual machine, and do not wish to
keep any of the data, make use of<code>vagrant destroy</code>. Again, this <em>will remove</em>
all of the data within the virtual machine and all software will have to be
reinstalled. If you wish to just temporarily bring down the virtual machine,
the other two commands should be explored in the <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/teardown.html">Vagrant documentation</a>.</p>

<a id="installation-on-a-bare-machine" class="anchor" href="#installation-on-a-bare-machine" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation on a bare machine</h3>

<p><em>THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH.</em></p>

<p>You can use the bootstrap shell script to set up the environment on a machine
running Ubuntu. It may work on Debian and other debian-derivitive distributions
using apt as their package managers, but these have not been tested.</p>

<p>To run the bootstrap script, fire up a terminal and pipe the script straight
into bash, like so:</p>

<pre><code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AABoyles/eldiablo/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
</code></pre>

<p>It should demand your password once, and then run everything requiring
superuser access as superuser, and everything else as whatever user you're
logged in as.  It uses relative paths, so you should be able to install it
just about anywhere on the filesystem, as suits your preferences.</p>

<h2>
<a id="other-information" class="anchor" href="#other-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Information</h2>

<p>Currently the virtual machine takes up 4GB of RAM. Less than this doesn't
really work since the shift-reduce parser needs a fair amount of memory to
operate.</p>

<p>For the two Github repositories, <code>scraper</code> and <code>phoenix_pipeline</code>, each time
<code>vagrant up</code> is run the most recent version of the code is pulled from Github.
If you have a long-running virtual machine and wish to obtain the latest code,
you can <code>cd</code> into the appropriate directory and run <code>git pull</code>.</p>
